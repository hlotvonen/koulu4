You stare at it’s fin incessantly and you start to begin to understand its form under the water. It has to weight at least 10 kilograms. You are already a meter away from it and you stretch yourself over it, ready to grab it from its neck. The salmon senses your intentions, its tail stirs the water and it rushes forward. You slam your hand into the water trying to grab it but you fail completely and fall into the water. The current snatches you instantly and you feel how your boots start to fill with water. You fumble trying to correct yourself back up, but you can’t get a hold of anything. The air inside your boots keep your feet floating but your head underwater. Your head hits something and you fall into the darkness...</p>

You dash your hand into the water, trying to grab its tail. The salmon startles and gets away from your grip but it’s too tired to move more than a meter. You approach the salmon again and this time you grab it with both hands. Miraculously you manage to get a good grip of its tail and stick your fingers through it gills, lifting it up from the water. It's a big one. It looks at you with its joyless eyes and lets out this most bizarre jazz song...</p>

You don’t really smoke, you say to yourself, but in the past months you’ve begun to smoke more and more: at parties, at school during breaks, alone at home when you are stressed out... the nicotine rush you get from smoking is one of the only things that takes your mind off of things even for a while and helps you relax.

In it you had to create a character and save a town from an evil wizard. The book was divided into a series of numbered sections and the player had to choose a non-sequential option which in turn provides an outcome for the player’s decision. The story continued like this, the player continuing to pick other their path until dying or winning the wizard.. which never happened unless because the game was so hard.

        <p>You head to the nearby bar. You order a glass of beer and find an empty table. You sit there alone and quiet for a while, staring into the distance. You are tired, tired of everything. You are tired of thinking about the assignment, you don’t feel like going to school tomorrow, you are tired of stressing out. You just want to drink beer and be alone. Somehow you start to feel relaxed, but at the same time you feel melancholic... "it's strange feeling... when one doesn't have the ability to think for theirselves. what should one do with that kind of life..." </p>

        <p>Fortunately you live next to a nice park where it’s nice to walk and think about stuff. You head to the park. It’s dark already and there’s nobody to be seen: no distractions. You start to reflect on the play session and the assignment. Little by little anxiety starts to fade out and inspiration emerges: you could do a text-adventure about making a text-adventure, about your current life and your situation. At the same time you could unburden your thoughts and open up the so-called "process of a creative", but so that anybody could relate to it... maybe you’ll manage to do something for tomorrow after all! The story could start with laying down on the floor...</p>
        <p>After about half an hour walk you have some kind of idea how you are going to create the game. You get back inside and now you would just have to start working...</p>

        <p>You feel dirty and uncomfortable, so you decide to take a shower. You sit down on the shower floor and let the hot water wash away all of your sorrows. Shower is the only place in your home where you can slow down and let your mind wander. New ideas start to emerge from underneath all the anxiety and you start to reflect on the play session and the assignment. Little by little you become inspired: you could do a text-adventure about making a text-adventure, about your current life and situation. At the same time you could unburden your thoughts and open up the so-called "process of a creative", so that anybody could relate to it... maybe you’ll manage to do something for tomorrow after all!

        <p>You decide to get to work immediately. You sit in front of your computer, but as soon as you open the browser window you somehow instantly forget what you were supposed to be doing. Instead you open facebook. Then you get bored. Then you visit reddit for a while. You stare at the bright screen and your brain is idling. You need some entertainment, a little break, before you can get to work, but you feel like nothing is enough. Nothing gives you enough satisfaction. Some hours later you realize that it’s already three in the morning. You get pissed at yourself. You feel like a moth, endlessly flying around a lightbulb. You can’t do anything about it, you can’t do anything about anything. You can’t do anything about yourself. You don’t understand why "Why don’t I just DO things?" you think as you last thought before you pass out on the bed with your clothes on and tears in your eyes.</p>

Oh yeah. You walk to your computer with the sandwich. "Now’s a good time to take a break from the hard work! I can’t work while I eat anyways" You decide to entertain yourself somehow while you eat...</p>

        <p>You take a pipe and a jar of cannabis from the drawer. You fix a little nugget of green to the bowl, light it up, and start to bubble. The chamber fills with a mellow warm grey smoke. You lift your thumb from the air hole and inhale. The smoke fills your lungs, your eyes close. A feeling that you have all the time and energy in the world surrounds you. You descend slowly to the floor. You lay down and caress the atoms of the floor with your fingertips. You are a planet that circles around a cosmic solitude. An Assignment emerges out of the center of the cosmos. It says: "Chkk chkk" and gestures "OK" with its fingers. You now understand what you need to do. You will do a text-adventure game about making a text-adventure game, ergo about your current life and situation. At the same time you could unburden yourself and open up the famous "process of a creative", but so that anybody could relate to it... The story starts with you laying down on the floor...</p>

        <p>You go to your computer and decide to play a bit of FPS-game first and then get to work. You open the game, log into a multiplayer server and start owning the shit out of everybody. You feel invincible and don’t want to quit in the middle of a good streak. "One more round and then I’ll start working" you say to yourself. After every match.</p>
        <p>Two hours later you are screaming "MOTHERFUCKERRRRRRR" to the computer screen and banging your keyboard in a fit of rage. The enemies have started dominating you and you are failing hard. You die to everything constantly, but you can’t understand why since just a moment ago you were doing so well. You just can’t stop, you want to kill them all, achieve the feeling of invincibility once more. One more match.</p> 
        <p>As the first sunrays of the morning strikes your face you realize that all hope is lost. It’s 5 in the morning. Your eyes are barely open and you are mad at yourself. The game sucked, you didn’t finish the assignment and your sleep will be horrible too. That’s that then, fucking shit.</p>

You quit school, go to work in a warehouse which turns into a permanent and steady job with flexible hours. You understand the importance of friendships, family and solidarity to be the most important aspects of life and you concentrate on those. After years, you move to Lapland where you find peace and the love of your life. You fondly reminisce your years in school and the friends you made there, but not the work-related stress. You win life, even though you lose this game.</p>
